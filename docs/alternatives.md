## 1. Prometheus

### What It Is

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit originally developed at SoundCloud in 2012. It's designed for reliability and is particularly strong in cloud-native environments, especially Kubernetes. It's now a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.

### Architecture

Prometheus uses a **pull-based architecture** where it actively scrapes metrics from targets at regular intervals.

**Core Components**:

1. **Prometheus Server**
   - **Retrieval**: Scrapes metrics from configured targets using HTTP
   - **Time-Series Database (TSDB)**: Stores metrics locally with timestamps
   - **HTTP Server**: Serves web UI and API on port 9090

2. **Exporters**
   - Bridge applications that don't natively expose Prometheus metrics
   - Convert system/service metrics to Prometheus format
   - Expose metrics on `/metrics` HTTP endpoint
   - Examples: Node Exporter (system metrics), MySQL Exporter, Blackbox Exporter

3. **Pushgateway** (Optional)
   - For short-lived jobs that can't be scraped
   - Jobs push metrics to gateway
   - Prometheus scrapes gateway on schedule

4. **Alertmanager** (Optional)
   - Handles alerts sent by Prometheus server
   - Manages deduplication, grouping, routing
   - Sends notifications via email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

5. **Service Discovery**
   - Automatically discovers targets to monitor
   - Integrations: Kubernetes, Consul, AWS, DNS
   - Dynamic target configuration

**Data Flow**:
```
Target Systems → Exporters → Prometheus Server (Pull) → TSDB Storage
                                ↓
                          Alert Rules → Alertmanager → Notifications
                                ↓
                          PromQL Queries → Grafana (Visualization)
```

### How It Works

1. **Metric Collection**:
   - Prometheus scrapes `/metrics` endpoint of targets every 10-60 seconds (configurable)
   - Exporters translate system metrics to Prometheus format
   - Metrics include labels (key-value pairs) for multidimensional data

2. **Metric Storage**:
   - TSDB stores time-series data locally on disk
   - Default retention: 15 days (configurable)
   - Efficient compression using chunks
   - Can integrate with remote storage (Thanos, Cortex) for long-term retention

3. **Querying**:
   - PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) for data analysis
   - Powerful aggregation, filtering, and mathematical operations
   - Example: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])` - request rate over 5 minutes

4. **Alerting**:
   - Alert rules defined in Prometheus configuration
   - Rules evaluated periodically against metrics
   - When conditions met, alerts sent to Alertmanager
   - Alertmanager handles notification routing and silencing

5. **Visualization**:
   - Built-in web UI for basic queries and graphs
   - Typically paired with Grafana for rich dashboards
   - Grafana connects to Prometheus as data source

### Metric Format

```
# HELP http_requests_total Total HTTP requests
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{method="GET",status="200"} 1234
http_requests_total{method="POST",status="200"} 567
```

### Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional data model**: Metrics with labels enable flexible querying
- **Pull-based collection**: Prometheus controls scraping schedule
- **PromQL**: Powerful query language for analysis
- **No external dependencies**: Self-contained server
- **Service discovery**: Automatic target detection
- **Open source**: Free and widely adopted

### Limitations

- **Local storage limitations**: Not ideal for long-term retention without remote storage
- **No built-in high availability**: Single server architecture (HA requires Thanos/Cortex)
- **Pull model challenges**: Can't monitor short-lived jobs without Pushgateway
- **No built-in alerting UI**: Requires Alertmanager setup
- **Steep learning curve**: PromQL requires expertise

### Best For

- Kubernetes and containerized environments
- Microservices architectures
- Teams with technical expertise
- Cloud-native applications
- DevOps/SRE teams

### Cost

- **Open source**: Free
- **Infrastructure costs**: Self-hosted (compute, storage)
- **Managed options**: Grafana Cloud (paid), AWS Managed Prometheus (pay per metrics)

## 2. Netdata

### What It Is

Netdata is a distributed, real-time infrastructure monitoring platform designed for per-second granularity. It's known for its zero-configuration approach, beautiful web UI, and edge-first architecture. Originally open-source, it now offers both a free Community tier and paid Cloud features.

### Architecture

Netdata uses a **distributed edge-native architecture** where each agent is a complete monitoring system.

**Core Components**:

1. **Netdata Agent**
   - Complete monitoring stack in a single process
   - Data collection, storage, query engine, ML, alerting
   - Written primarily in C for performance
   - Runs on every monitored node

2. **DBENGINE (Local TSDB)**
   - Custom time-series database embedded in agent
   - Extremely efficient: ~0.6 bytes per sample at Tier 0
   - Multi-tier storage: per-second, per-minute, per-hour
   - Automatic compression and retention management

3. **Data Collection**
   - 800+ built-in collectors (plugins)
   - Auto-detection of services
   - Internal plugins (C) and external plugins (Python, Go, Bash)
   - Supports both pull and push architectures
   - eBPF for kernel-level metrics collection

4. **Machine Learning**
   - Trained at the edge on each agent
   - Unsupervised anomaly detection
   - No data sent to cloud for ML training
   - Models shared across agents in HA clusters

5. **Netdata Parents (Optional)**
   - Centralization points for multiple agents
   - Agents stream to parents to reduce load
   - Provides HA and persistent storage for ephemeral nodes
   - Doesn't become bottleneck (heavy lifting at edge)

6. **Netdata Cloud (Optional)**
   - Centralized dashboard for multiple agents
   - User management, RBAC, alert routing
   - Agents remain independent (work offline)
   - Cloud doesn't store metrics (queries agents directly)

**Data Flow**:
```
Netdata Agent (Full Stack) → Local TSDB + Dashboard
       ↓ (Optional)
Netdata Parent (Aggregation) → Centralized Storage
       ↓ (Optional)
Netdata Cloud (Dashboard) → Query Agents/Parents Directly
```

### How It Works

1. **Per-Second Collection**:
   - Collects thousands of metrics every second
   - Zero configuration - auto-detects services
   - Minimal resource usage (~5% CPU, 150MB RAM by default)
   - Uses only idle CPU cycles

2. **Edge Storage**:
   - Data stored locally on each agent (not centralized)
   - Multi-tier database: Tier 0 (per-second), Tier 1 (per-minute), Tier 2 (per-hour)
   - Automatic aggregation preserves min/max/avg/anomaly count
   - Retention limited only by disk space

3. **Distributed Queries**:
   - Netdata Cloud queries agents in real-time
   - No data centralization bottleneck
   - Query routing optimized to minimize data transfer
   - Agents cache metadata for fast lookups

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - ML models trained locally on each agent
   - Detects deviations from normal patterns
   - No manual threshold configuration
   - Active-active HA: first parent trains, others reuse model

5. **Alerting**:
   - Two alert types: monitoring (humans) and automation (scripts)
   - Alerts evaluated at edge for instant detection
   - Can execute scripts when alerts trigger
   - Parents handle monitoring alerts; agents handle automation

6. **Visualization**:
   - Built-in web dashboard (agent on port 19999)
   - Netdata Cloud for multi-node dashboards
   - Real-time, no refresh lag
   - Automatic dashboard generation

### Key Features

- **Per-second metrics**: Highest resolution monitoring available
- **Zero configuration**: Auto-detects and monitors everything
- **Distributed architecture**: Infinite horizontal scaling
- **Built-in ML**: Unsupervised anomaly detection
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, intuitive dashboards
- **Edge-first**: Data stays local, queries go to data
- **Minimal resources**: Optimized C code, ~0.6 bytes/sample
- **Offline capability**: Agents work without cloud connectivity

### Netdata Cloud Pricing

- 5 active nodes simultaneously
- Unlimited total nodes (but only 5 "active" at once)
- Alert notifications from inactive nodes visible
- Unlimited metrics collection
- Unlimited retention (stored on agents)

### Limitations

- **No centralized log storage**: Metrics stay at edge (by design)
- **Cloud free tier limited**: Only 5 active nodes for visualization
- **Learning curve for advanced features**: Simple to start, complex to master
- **Less mature ecosystem**: Fewer third-party integrations than Prometheus
